## Development

```console
mkdir extensions
go run ./cmd/marketplace/main.go server --extensions-dir ./extensions
```

When you make a change that affects people deploying the marketplace please
update the changelog as part of your PR.

You can use `make gen` to generate a mock `extensions` directory for testing and
`make upload` to upload them to an Artifactory repository.

## Tests

To run the tests:

```
make test
```

To run the Artifactory tests against a real repository instead of a mock:

```
export ARTIFACTORY_URI=myuri
export ARTIFACTORY_REPO=myrepo
export ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN=mytoken
make test
```

See the readme for using the marketplace with code-server.

When testing with code-server you may run into issues with content security
policy if the marketplace runs on a different domain over HTTP; in this case you
will need to disable content security policy in your browser or manually edit
the policy in code-server's source.
